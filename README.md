# 🌾 GrainPalette: Rice Type Classifier

GrainPalette is a deep learning-based web application that classifies different 
types of rice grains using **transfer learning**. By leveraging powerful 
pre-trained models, the system achieves high accuracy and efficient classification 
of rice types. It allows users to upload images of rice grains and returns the 
predicted class instantly through a web interface.
